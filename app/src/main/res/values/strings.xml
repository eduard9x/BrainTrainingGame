        \ This game is played using the keypad. The aim is to answer mathematical questions as fast as possible.\n\ \n\ If the result is NOT a whole number, it should be rounded to the closest one.\n\ \n\
        For example, the expression 10/3*2 should evaluate to 6, because 10/3 is 3.333 which is rounded to 3, then multiplied by 2, giving the overall result of 6.
