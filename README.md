# BrainTrainingGame
Brain Training Game Android app â€“ Uni project.

- This game is supposed to calculate simple mathematical questions, from left to right.
It is not the mathematical way, when the multiplication & division are being done first.
The lecturer said it might be difficult for most of the students to do it.

I have created that part as well. Just need to implement it after the deadline is gone.

//todo implement the mathematical way to answer questions.
//todo add more seconds to the timer.
